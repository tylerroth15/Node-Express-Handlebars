In this project, we were tasked with creating a hamburger builder utilizing MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. The purpose is to use this as a resturant app, the server will input the burger the customer ordered and it will appear on the left handside of the screen a bright red button that reads Devour It. Once this burger has been delivered to the customer you will press the button and the burger will move to the right handside of the screen to clearly depicting that this particular burger is no longer waiting to be delivered.
